## Build 

Open Unity, then open the whole folder.<br>
File -> Build & Run<br>


## Run
### Usage:

````
Click on the round grid and add food.
Click Space to start. 
You could add the food on the run.
There will be animal sounds.
Click Space again to stop.
````

## My Musical Statement  
It's fairly simple.
**Just a sequencer with rigid timing.** Animal sounds are fun though.
